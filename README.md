The bootleg Roomba compares which is the better agent, The simple reflex agent (an agent that only reacts to bumps), The simple random reflex agent (an agent that reacts to bumps and will randomly choose an action), and the tabled agent (an agent that reacts to sensors inputs and will make random actions, all actions will be saved on a tabled and the agent will choose its next best choice of actions).


The Missionary and Cannibals compares two algorithms to see which is the better algorithm. Breadth-First search is compared against Depth-Limited search and in this problem, DLS is faster than BFS.
